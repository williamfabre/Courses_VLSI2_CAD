Adjusting Core to Left to: 20.0900. Core to Bottom to: 20.0900.
Horizontal Layer M1 offset = 205 (guessed)
Vertical Layer M2 offset = 205 (derived)
Suggestion: specify LAYER OFFSET in LEF file
Reason: hard to extract LAYER OFFSET from standard cells
Generated pitch 1.025 in M6 is different from 0.9 defined in technology file in preferred direction.
